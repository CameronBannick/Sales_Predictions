# Sales Predictions Data Report
Cameron Bannick
# Issue Adressed
This project consisted of two main sections, out exploratory data analysis with data visualizations and two models with the goal of gaining insight and predicting an items total outlet sales.
# Data Provided
The Data provided originally had the features of: 
Item_Identifier	Item_Weight	Item_Fat_Content	Item_Visibility	Item_Type	Item_MRP	Outlet_Identifier	Outlet_Establishment_Year	Outlet_Size	Outlet_Location_Type	Outlet_Type	Item_Outlet_Sales 
However, all visualizations and models were created using only:
Item_Fat_Content	Item_Visibility	Item_Type	Item_MRP	Item_Outlet_Sales
This was because these were the only features that had to do with the individual items themselves.
