# Sales_Predictions Data Report

# Issue Adressed
The goal was to provide some insight as to how much money we were making from each item and maximize on those insights.
# Data Provided
Data provided gave us eavh item with its retail price, type of food, market type, visibility to find possible insights. 
# Results 
First Visualization showed the Median of each items profits was 2000 dollars
Unfortunately the heatmap did not show us many correlations to anything 
I ran two models, one Linear Regression and one Bagged Tree and the Bagged Tree was the best option due to the better R2 score. However both models had a high MSE. My reccomendation would be to collect an expanded Data Set and see if more Data would improve on our error.
